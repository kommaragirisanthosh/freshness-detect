Overview
The Freshness Detector is a machine learning-based application designed to assess the freshness of fruits and vegetables using image analysis. By leveraging computer vision and deep learning techniques, the system predicts whether a produce item is fresh or spoiled, helping users reduce food waste and make informed decisions.

Features
Image Classification: Predicts freshness based on uploaded images of fruits and vegetables.

Multi-Class Support: Works with various produce types (e.g., apples, bananas, tomatoes).

User-Friendly Interface: Simple web or mobile interface for easy interaction.

Real-Time Processing: Quick analysis with results displayed in seconds.

How It Works
Input: User uploads an image of a fruit or vegetable.

Preprocessing: The image is resized, normalized, and enhanced for analysis.

Prediction: A trained CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) model evaluates the image.

Output: The system returns a freshness score (Fresh / Spoiled) along with confidence levels.

Installation
Prerequisites
Python 3.8+

TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch

OpenCV

Flask (for web deployment)

Steps
Clone the repository 
cd freshness-detector  
Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt  
Run the application:

python app.py  # For web interface  
Dataset
The model is trained on a custom dataset containing labeled images of fresh and spoiled fruits/vegetables. Example sources:

Kaggle Fresh vs. Rotten Fruits

Self-collected images under varying lighting conditions.

Model Performance
Accuracy: ~95% on test data (varies by produce type).

Supported Produce: Apples, Bananas, Oranges, Tomatoes, Lettuce, etc.

Usage
Open the web app or mobile interface.

Upload an image of the fruit/vegetable.

View the freshness prediction and confidence score.

Future Improvements
Expand dataset for more produce varieties.

Add nutritional degradation estimates over time.

Mobile app integration with camera API.
